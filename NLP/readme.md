## Introduction

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a fascinating field at the intersection of computer science and linguistics. It focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. This repository is a structured resource for learning NLP systematically, completing tasks, and working on real-world projects.

## Course Overview

This repository is structured around a course curriculum that includes:
1. **Introduction to NLP**: Fundamental concepts and libraries.
2. **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, etc.
3. **Word Embeddings**: Techniques like Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText.
4. **Language Models**: GPT, BERT, and other transformer-based models.
5. **NLP Applications**: Sentiment analysis, text classification, named entity recognition, and more.
