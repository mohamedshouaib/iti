What is ROUGE-N?
ROUGE-N (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a fundamental metric for evaluating how well a machine-generated summary matches human-written reference summaries. It works by comparing the overlap of word sequences (n-grams) between the generated and reference texts.
How It Works:
1- N-gram Matching: Counts how many word sequences of length N (single words, word pairs, etc.) appear in both texts
2- Three Key Scores:
        ◦ Recall: What percentage of reference n-grams appear in the generated text?
        ◦ Precision: What percentage of generated n-grams appear in the reference?
        ◦ F1 Score: The harmonic mean balancing recall and precision
          
Practical Example:
- Human Reference Summary:
	"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
- Machine-Generated Summary:
	"A fast brown fox leaps over a sleepy dog."
ROUGE-1 (Single Words) Analysis:
    • Matching words: brown, fox, over, dog (4 words)
    • Reference has 8 unique words → Recall = 4/8 = 50%
    • Generated has 8 unique words → Precision = 4/8 = 50%
    • F1 Score = 50%
ROUGE-2 (Word Pairs) Analysis:
    • Matching word pairs: "brown fox", "over the" (2 pairs)
    • Reference has 7 bigrams → Recall = 2/7 ≈ 29%
    • Generated has 7 bigrams → Precision = 2/7 ≈ 29%
    • F1 Score ≈ 29%
Key Insights from This Example:
    1. The system captured some core elements (fox, dog, jumping action)
    2. Missed exact phrasing ("quick" vs "fast", "jumps" vs "leaps")
    3. Shows ROUGE's limitation with synonyms - similar meaning but different words
When to Use ROUGE-N:
    • Best for evaluating content coverage in summarization
    • Most commonly used: ROUGE-1 (words) and ROUGE-2 (word pairs)
    • Standard in research papers and competitions
Important Limitations:
    • Doesn't understand meaning or synonyms
    • Favors longer summaries (higher recall)
    • Doesn't evaluate grammar or coherence
Practical Advice:
    • Always report both ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2
    • Include recall, precision and F1 scores
    • Combine with other metrics for complete evaluation
