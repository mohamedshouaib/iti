Empirical Evaluation of Gated Recurrent Neural Networks on Sequence Modeling
  
Objective:  
The paper compares the performance of three types of RNNs: Traditional tanh units, LSTM, GRUs
The focus is on evaluating the effectiveness of gated units (LSTM and GRU) in capturing long-term dependencies
Comparison  of Architecture:  
   - LSTM: Uses three gates input, forget, and output gates.  
   - GRU: Simpler than LSTM, with reset and update gates to modulate information flow but lacks a separate memory cell.  
- Both units employ additive updates, mitigating vanishing gradients by creating shortcut paths for error backpropagation.
Results:
    • Gated units (LSTM, GRU) outperforme better than RNNs, especially on speech tasks.
    • GRU:
        ◦ Fastest convergence (updates and CPU time)
        ◦ Best overall performance on most music datasets and one speech dataset
    • LSTM:
        ◦ Best performance on one speech dataset
    • Tanh RNNs: Significantly worse, especially on complex tasks like speech modeling    
Conclusions:  
- Gated units (LSTM/GRU) consistently outperformed tanh units, especially in complex tasks like speech modeling.  
- No clear winner between LSTM and GRU: Performance depended on the dataset/task.  
- GRUs showed computational advantages, often converging faster with comparable accuracy.
